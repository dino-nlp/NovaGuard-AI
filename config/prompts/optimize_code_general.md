**Examples of Code Optimization Suggestions:**

*Example 1: Python - Inefficient loop for string concatenation*
```python
# Assume language is Python
def join_strings_badly(string_list):
    result = ""
    for s in string_list:
        result += s # Inefficient for many strings
    return result
```
*Expected JSON Finding (as a list):*
```json

    "line_start": 4,
    "message": "Inefficient string concatenation in a loop. Using `+=` with strings repeatedly creates new string objects, which can be slow for large lists.",
    "optimization_type": "StringConcatenation",
    "explanation_steps": [
      "In Python, strings are immutable.",
      "Each `result += s` operation creates a new string object in memory and copies the content.",
      "For a large number of concatenations, this leads to quadratic time complexity."
    ],
    "suggested_change": "Use `"".join(string_list)` for efficient string concatenation from a list. Example: `return \"\".join(string_list)`",
    "estimated_impact": "medium", // Can be high for very large lists
    "confidence": "high"
